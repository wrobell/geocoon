GeoCoon is a library to integrate Shapely GIS geometries with Pandas data
frames.

GeoCoon supports

1. Point, line string and polygon geometries (more to come).
2. Vectorized GIS object properties access and method execution.
3. Pandas data selection and split-apply-combine idioms.
4. SQL/MM databases (i.e. PostgreSQL + Postgis).
5. Multiple geometry columns in a data frame.

GeoCoon requires Shapely 1.3.0, Pandas 0.13.0 and Python 3.

The software is distributed under GPL v3 licence.
